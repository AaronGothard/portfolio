 Hi, my name is Aaron Gothard and welcome to my portfolio! I am from a small village in Ohio called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Canton,_Ohio">East Canton</a> and I graduated from East Canton High School in May of 2021. I am now a mechanical engineering student at Vanderbilt University, where I am a James A. Clark Scholar and a career 29-2 in Vanderbilt Intramural Sports.
<br><br>
 I currently work as a MakerTech at the Wond'ry in Nashville, where I assist in the fabrication of a wide range of personal and professional projects: everything from workbenches to kaleidoscopes to bone biopsy training tools.
<br><br>
I would love to hear from you, whether it is just to chat or if you are looking for someone to join your team! My email and socials are all linked below if you want to check them out, and there is also a copy of my resume for your consideration. Have a great day!
