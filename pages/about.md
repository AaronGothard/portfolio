 Hi, my name is Aaron Gothard and welcome to my portfolio! I am from a small village in Ohio called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Canton,_Ohio">East Canton</a> and I graduated from East Canton High School in May of 2021. I am now a mechanical engineering student at Vanderbilt University, where I am a James A. Clark Scholar and a career 29-2 in Vanderbilt Intramural Sports.

 I currently work as a MakerTech at the Wond'ry in Nashville, where I assist in the fabrication of a wide range of personal and professional projects: everything from workbenches to kaleidoscopes to bone biopsy training tools.

I would love to hear from you, whether it is just to chat or if you are looking for someone to join your team! My email is aaron.m.gothard@vanderbilt.edu and my resume is linked <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>. Have a great day!
