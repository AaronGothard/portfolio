Helmet Hero is a multitool for maintaining Riddell Speedflex helmets. It began when the football coaching staff at East Canton High School approached us with an issue. The "Quick Release" pins that held their facemasks on could not be taken off and re-seated using First-Party tools. This means that if the facemask needs to be removed on the sideline for any reason, that player can't play until they go to the locker room or take an extra helmet.

I designed Helmet Hero in Fusion360 and 3D printed each iteration until it was suitable for the team to use. After seeing how well it worked for them, we decided to use this as a partner project for my STEM course with a classmate Joey Bellamy. After creating the mockup and running marketing numbers, we submitted our project for consideration in the "Stark Tank" Entrepenuership competition. We were finalists, and ended up getting fourth due to the fact that we didn't have sales quite yet. We still learned a lot about the product development process as well as winning a cash prize for our efforts.
