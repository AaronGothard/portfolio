This project is a Discord Bot that uses the Google Cloud Translation API to translate messages from text channels into different languages. This was created as a part of a VandyHacks Hackathon and was completed in one night by myself and a group with 3 of my friends. 
<br> <br>
We coded our bot in java, and it utilized both the Google Translate API and the Discord bot API. Our first iterations utilized text commands to translate the previous message in the channel. We later added the feature to "react" to the message with the flag of a country whose primary language you wanted to translate to. We then hosted it in our own personal server and that is where it lives today.

This experience was fun, but, most importantly, it taught me a lot about computer science as well as the processes behind software design.
