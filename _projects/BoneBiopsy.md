#### <b>Bone Biopsy Simulation<b>
<p style="font-size:15px; padding: 0 0 1em 0;">May, 2022</p>
This is a training tool for medical workers to learn how to safely and effectively perform a bone biopsy. This is better than alternatives as it is quite realistic without requiring human tissue. This was made in close collaboration with Dr. Nicholas Chadwick, a doctor at VUMC.
<br> <br>
I designed the models for the 3 separate layers of tissue in CAD, and used them to create 3d printed positive molds. Using vacuum formed plastic, I poured different materials into their respective molds in order to properly simulate the visual and tactile feedback expected during the drilling process. 
<br> <br>
There were a few main considerations for the design process. First, we wanted to include a variable width on the medullary and cortical bones to simulate a wider range of bone compositions. Next, we wanted to ensure the soft tissue layer was soft enough to be realistic, but durable enough to withstand many punctures. The last major consideration was finding the perfect hardnesses for the two different bone layers.

This was a great project to be a part of, and it is going to continue into the spring semester of 2023 in a research for credit format.
